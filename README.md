We wanted evaluate the market components of coffee. What are the contributing factors that affect pricing, supply and demand. We also wanted to evaluate weather conditions in the biggest coffee producing nation, Brazil. They are responsible for nearly half of the worldwide output. #####

# Production Section - Charlie Stanley 

#### All coffee production data was downloaded from the International Coffee Organization (ICO) website.  The ICO has production data going back to 1990;  this analysis covers 2015 - 2019, the most up to date, complete dataset available. Coffee production remained stable during this period with a slight downturn in 2019. ####

# Conclusion #

#### Coffee price and production have a close correlation due to the basic law of supply and demand. We noticed consumption is relatively flat, which indicates there is steady consumption of coffee yearly with minimal seasonality. While weather is an important factor to production, based on our dataset, we were unable to find a direct correlation to the production.

As an entrepreneur the coffee market is an attractive industry to enter based on the fact that consumption seems stable. Any new entrants would need to focus mainly on price fluctuations based on production, keeping in mind that climate change is impacting this industry. ####
